// Evidence for the search-cpamp-only rule: which CPAMP events match a search term only through
// fields that Prox does not store. CPAMP keeps one search document per event (fields joined by
// char(31)); a term without wildcards is in the document exactly when it is in one field, and a
// term with `%` or `_` is matched field by field (usageevent/analytics.go, and usagemonitoring
// filter.go, which exclude "%_\x1f" from the document path), so a wildcard never bridges two
// fields. Read-only; the CPAMP handle comes from openParityReader.
