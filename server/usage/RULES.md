# Usage collection, storage, pricing and analytics ownership

This package owns usage collection from the proxies, the event store, pricing and
the analytics calculations. It is the `prox-usage` service: its own process and
unit, not part of the history server.

- `prox-usage` is the only consumer of the proxies' usage stream and the only
  live process that opens `usage.sqlite`. Other services read through its loopback
  HTTP API. The offline operator parity reader is the exception documented below.
  The history server, the browser and the exporter never open the file.
- The thread that owns sockets makes no SQLite call. There is exactly one write
  connection, in the writer worker; every write is a job in its queue. Readers
  are read-only and bounded by the request deadline.
- An event's identity is its `execution_id`. Inserts are idempotent. Rows are
  never updated after insertion; a correction is a typed, tested migration.
- Tokens come from the proxy's canonical breakdown. No provider-specific
  inference is added here; a record without a complete breakdown is kept,
  flagged and priced as partial.
- Stored values never depend on the rate book. Prices are current configured
  rates applied at query time; the book file is the only source of prices; a
  missing rate is unknown, never zero.
- Percentiles are exact nearest rank over positive samples. No approximation is
  introduced without changing the contract.
- A response is computed in one read snapshot. Coverage states what is known:
  pruned ranges and recorded collection gaps make `raw_complete` false; retained
  events are not an ingress ledger; estimates are not bills.
- Stored and returned fields are an allowlist. Client keys are stored only as
  SHA-256; fail bodies, response headers and credential files are never stored.
  Account labels come from the proxies' credential listing through the
  management API, never from files on disk.
- Search is bounded by the requested range. A query with a search term never
  occupies the fast lane.
- A management authentication failure backs off for at least a minute; the
  collector must never cause an address ban.
- Tests and browser exercises use synthetic data only.

## Module layout

- `types.ts`, `normalize.ts` and `schema.ts` hold no SQLite import, so any thread
  may load them. `store.ts` is the only module that opens a database. Import it
  from the writer worker and the query workers only; a test asserts the first
  three stay free of it.
- Workers are threads (`new Worker`), decided by the P0 spike on the pinned Bun
  1.4.3: a read-only scan of a million rows and a concurrent writer left the main
  thread's 250 ms timer at most 19 ms late under full CPU and disk load, with no
  `SQLITE_BUSY`. Workers speak one message shape, `{id, kind, body}` in and
  `{id, ok, body}` out, so the same entry file also runs as a child process
  (`Bun.spawn` with IPC) if threads ever have to be abandoned.
- Every worker file is its own `bun build` entry point, and its path is resolved
  at run time beside the main bundle (`.ts` from source, `.js` from the bundle).
  `bun build` does not follow `new Worker(new URL('./x.worker.ts', import.meta.url))`:
  it leaves the `.ts` path in the output and the bundle fails at start.

## The store

- Two files. `usage.sqlite` holds events; `usage-raw.sqlite` is a 30-day buffer of
  sanitized payloads for re-deriving events, never read by analytics, and safe to
  delete while the service is stopped. Both are WAL with `synchronous=NORMAL`.
- `events` is clustered by `(ts_ms, seq)` and holds integers only; repeated
  strings live once in `dim`. `event_detail` holds identifiers, joined by `seq`.
  `execution_id` is unique there, and the insert is `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`: the
  first arrival of an execution stays, whichever way it arrived (`ingest`).
- `seq` is ingestion order from `meta.next_seq`. A duplicate consumes none.
- Schema changes are numbered, forward-only migrations (`USAGE_MIGRATIONS` in
  `schema.ts`), counted in `meta.schema_version` and run by the writer at start.
  The initial schema is migration 1. Append; never edit one that has shipped. A
  database newer than the build is refused. A migration that rewrites a table
  runs as a governed bulk job, not at start. The raw buffer has no migrations.
- Sessions live in `session`, one row per UUID, never in `dim`: there are
  hundreds of thousands a year and search scans `dim`. `derived` is 1 for a UUID
  of version 8, which the proxy derives itself (from context or a hash of the
  first messages), so a derived session can merge unrelated conversations and
  must be labelled, never attributed across clients. `parent_id` links a
  subagent's session to its parent; the first parent reported for a session
  stays. `event_detail` keeps what each event itself reported.
- `events.auth_index_id` is the proxy's credential index (`dim` kind
  `auth_index`), kept whatever the account label says: it is the only key that
  joins usage to quota.
- `usage_flags`: bit 0 usage presence reported, bits 1 to 6 the components the
  proxy observed (input, output, reasoning, cache read, cache creation, total),
  bit 7 the token columns come from a complete canonical breakdown, bit 8 the
  payload carried a `usage_fields` object (so "all false" differs from "absent").
- With bit 7 clear, the token columns hold the proxy's raw counters as reported:
  `input_total` and `input_uncached` both hold the reported input, and
  `input_total = input_uncached + cache_read + cache_write` does not hold. Such an
  event is priced as partial. Imported history is the exception to the raw-counter
  layout: with bit 7 clear it preserves CPAMP's persisted normalized columns,
  still priced as partial.

## The normalizer

`normalizeUsagePayload` is the one pure function from a payload
(`CLIProxyAPI/internal/redisqueue/plugin.go`, `queuedUsageDetail`) to a row.

- A complete breakdown means `accounting_version` 2, breakdown schema version 2,
  quality `complete`, no unclassified tokens, non-negative integers, and sums that
  add up. Anything else falls back to the raw counters.
- The model is the alias, else the upstream model, with a trailing reasoning
  suffix removed: `(none|auto|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max|-1)` in any case,
  or a non-negative integer. The billing model is the upstream model, else that.
- The pricing tier: an explicit effective tier replaces the requested tier; then
  for Codex (recognized from executor, provider or auth type) the request wins
  over the response, and for every other provider the response wins.
- `latency_ms` is kept only when positive. `ttft_ms` is null when negative or when
  the method is `unavailable`; a zero is kept only for a method the proxy names.
- `ts_ms` is the proxy's RFC 3339 `timestamp` truncated to milliseconds.
- The path loses its query string before it is stored, because a query string can
  carry a client credential. The user agent and client address are reduced to one
  bounded line; the credential scrubber for returned text belongs to the query
  engine.
- The raw buffer keeps only allowlisted keys. `api_key`, `source`,
  `access_token_sha256`, `response_headers` and `fail.body` are removed; a key the
  normalizer does not know is dropped and counted in `payloads.dropped_keys`.
- A payload that is not a JSON object is counted in `rejects` without its text:
  text that cannot be allowlisted is never stored.

Regression coverage lives in `tests/proxUsageNormalize.test.ts` and
`tests/proxUsageStore.test.ts`, with synthetic payloads from
`tests/fixtures/usagePayloads.ts` shaped like the proxy's own plugin tests.

## Collection and writer queue

- `main.ts`, `collector.ts`, `resp.ts`, `labels.ts`, `status.ts` and `writer.ts`
  own sockets, source lifecycle, credential snapshots, HTTP and worker messaging.
  Their runtime import graph never reaches `bun:sqlite`; the service test walks
  that graph. The writer entry is resolved beside the running bundle at runtime.
- A source authenticates and waits for the `SUBSCRIBE usage` acknowledgement
  before reading the non-destructive v8 usage log with `after_seq` and pages of
  at most 1000 records. `replay.ts` validates the numbered envelope. Both RESP and
  HTTP authentication failures block that source's management requests for at
  least 60 seconds. A 400 or malformed page backs off without popping or advancing.
- Per-source `(boot_id, queue_seq)` lives in `meta` under `cursor:<instance>`;
  `cursor-at:<instance>` records its commit time for coverage when no heartbeat
  exists yet. Each cursor update commits in the event transaction, including
  duplicate/rejected records and empty pages advancing past pruned records.
  Transport metadata is never retained by the payload normalizer.
- Live records continue entering the writer during replay, with cursor updates
  withheld until continuity is established. Replay stops at the first numbered
  live overlap or a short/empty page; a final writer barrier commits the accepted
  live suffix before switching back to ordinary live cursor commits. Execution
  identity deduplicates all overlap. Source state is `replaying` until then.
- The destructive pop drain is removed. The C1 replay log retains every record
  independently of subscribers, including everything placed in the legacy pop
  queue. Emptying that queue adds no recovery coverage and would consume records
  for another legacy reader. Existing status counters `drainRequests`/`drained`
  now count committed replay pages/payloads.
- Shutdown keeps accepting messages until `UNSUBSCRIBE` acknowledges. Only then
  does it flush accepted batches and close the writer. Missing acknowledgements
  and event-store failures produce an unsuccessful exit, not a successful flush.
- The main thread dispatches at 100 payloads or 50 ms. Its backlog includes
  buffered payloads and every batch awaiting a worker acknowledgement. Above
  50,000 it drops all subscriptions, records gaps, and waits until at most 1,000
  remain before reconnecting. The proxy's replay log retains traffic even while
  another subscriber (including CPAMP) remains connected. Retention time, record
  and byte caps can still prune it before recovery.
- The worker serializes every write through `enqueueJob(kind, fn)`; `live` jobs
  precede waiting background jobs. P3 supplies bounded import, backup and prune
  chunks through that hook, including the roadmap's byte/IO governor. No bulk
  jobs or automatic raw-buffer pruning run in P2.
- Heartbeats commit every 10 seconds after replay, behind accepted events.
  Startup and dropped connections create a provisional `ingest_gaps` interval;
  its row ID is tracked in `meta` under `recovery-gap:<instance>` so retries and
  process restarts extend the same uncertain interval. Final recovery clears
  only that provisional row in the cursor transaction when coverage is proven.
  A saved cursor proving full recovery leaves no gap, even with a heartbeat older
  than the retention window.
- Before writer initialization returns, every cursorless source with a persisted
  heartbeat enters provisional recovery, even when the heartbeat is equal to or
  later than the current clock. New gaps freeze their receipt checkpoint before
  subscription/credential refresh can commit live traffic. The gap starts at the
  heartbeat, with its end clamped to at least that start. Extending recovery never
  creates or moves an existing pending gap's checkpoint; older missing checkpoints
  remain unknown.
- Within one boot, each replay page starts with the pruned interval
  `(after_seq, oldest_seq)` and excludes its overlap with the same-boot live range
  accepted on the current ordered subscription. The replay writer barrier requires
  successful live-commit acknowledgements before posting the page's gap/cursor
  transaction. Only the uncovered count is recorded as `missed`, and only when
  positive; retention of already-received live records creates no loss gap. The
  interval starts at the disconnect, previous heartbeat or cursor commit time.
  A changed boot commits a `proxy-restart` gap with `missed=NULL`, resets to zero
  and replays the new process. Cross-process loss cannot be counted. Graceful
  shutdown needs only the existing unsubscribe acknowledgement and writer flush.
- With no saved cursor, `after_seq=0` adopts retained history; sequences pruned
  before that first checkpoint do not provide a numeric missed count. A source
  with no previous outage history creates no historical loss claim. An existing
  cursorless outage stays uncertain until replay includes a same-source execution
  stored at or before the gap's receipt-order checkpoint. Creating a provisional
  gap atomically saves `meta.recovery-checkpoint:<instance>` as the last assigned
  ingestion sequence (`meta.next_seq - 1`); extending a gap never changes it.
  Only an existing `events.seq <= checkpoint` proves retained coverage. Wall-clock
  receipt/request timestamps cannot prove it: clocks can move backward. The check
  runs before page inserts, in their transaction. Live/replay rows committed after
  the checkpoint never qualify. An older pending gap without a checkpoint stays
  unknown; retry/startup must not fabricate one from newer receipts.
- `meta.recovery-unanchored:<instance>` marks cursorless uncertainty and survives
  intermediate cursor commits/restarts. A pre-outage receipt clears the marker;
  completing replay then removes the provisional gap and its checkpoint. Without
  such evidence, completion keeps the interval with `missed=NULL` and detaches its recovery
  metadata so subsequent reconnects cannot erase it. Stored-cursor boot changes
  remain separate `proxy-restart` gaps. Retention caps, missing history or absent
  source attribution can prevent proof even when actual loss is unknown.
- Existing numbered gaps lack first-run/cursor provenance and cannot be deleted
  automatically by signature. The two reported first-run false gaps require the
  operator-only, ID-and-value-guarded procedure in
  [the repair note](../../docs/usage-first-replay-gap-repair.md).
- Credential refreshes keep the last good snapshot; unknown indices trigger at
  most one refresh per 10 seconds. Each queued event carries its label snapshot
  so later credential changes cannot relabel an accepted event.
- An event commit and its optional raw-buffer write are separate transactions.
  A failed raw write is logged without payload/error text and increments
  `rawBufferFailures`. Committed events stay acknowledged; subsequent batches
  continue. A failed event commit stops collection and exits unsuccessfully.
- P2 serves only loopback `/healthz` and bearer-protected `/v1/status`. P5 adds
  query workers and analytics; E3 adds a separate metrics-only bridge listener.
  Neither analytics routing nor the history/exporter consumer changes in P2.
- Both usage entry points ship in the existing history image. Deployment hashes
  both bundles and restarts the separate usage unit only when that hash changes.
  Manifest or unit changes alone require an explicit operator restart.

Collector, writer and service regressions use the ephemeral in-process proxy in
`tests/helpers/usageFakeProxy.ts`, synthetic payloads, and small temporary files.

## Rate book and pricing

- `rates.ts` validates the version-1 JSON boundary and owns rate overrides,
  canonical revisions and the loader. All four rate fields are required; use
  `null` for unconfigured and `0` for explicitly free. Unconfigured tier fields
  inherit the base rate. Context thresholds must be distinct positive integers;
  service names match case-insensitively and cannot overlap between rows.
- `price_revision` hashes canonical JSON with sorted object keys after removing
  model `source` and `updated_at_ms`. It is specific to this book format, not
  CPAMP's Go serialization. Loader snapshots are immutable; each query uses one
  snapshot. Failed reads/validation retain the previous book and expose `error`.
- `pricing.ts` owns candidate resolution, estimate statuses/reasons, combining
  known subtotals, context-band selection and the catalog/observed rate inventory.
  The final service `names` entry is its inventory label; the CPAMP exporter
  writes `[mode, service_tier]` (deduplicated). All names price the same row.
- SQL aggregation must group by usage flags and record kind as well as model,
  tier and context band, so measured zero and unknown presence cannot be merged.
  Pass `contextThreshold: null` for the base band or the selected threshold for
  a context band. Never classify a sum as if it were one large request. An
  aggregate with multiple calls and configured context tiers must pass its band.
- Incomplete breakdowns (bit 7 clear) add `usage-components-unreported`; live
  counters remain raw and imported history preserves CPAMP's persisted columns.
  No provider cache inference, built-in prices, premiums, service multipliers or
  legacy cache rate is used. Missing cache-write rates
  use input; other missing components are dropped with CPAMP's exact reason.
- One-time migration: `bun scripts/usage-export-cpamp-rates.ts <book.json>
  [cpamp-usage.sqlite]`. It opens only the CPAMP source with `mode=ro`, read-only
  flags and `query_only=1`; only the three price tables and `api_key_aliases` are
  read. It refuses existing output files and also writes
  `<book.json>.client-aliases.json` containing `client_alias` rows for a later
  writer-worker import. Neither the Prox database nor configuration is updated.
  D5's two missing models are added with null rates and source `pending D5`;
  approved prices are required before deploying that book.

## Bulk jobs (import, reconcile, verify, backup and prune)

`ioGovernor.ts` owns bulk IO admission and pacing. Share one `IoGovernor` in the
writer worker. `waitForQuietIo(signal)` admits work only below 5% `full avg10` IO
PSI. At or above 15%, recovery requires 30 continuous seconds below 5%. Missing
PSI fails closed. A pause longer than six hours invokes `reportLongPause` once
(or warns to stderr when no callback is supplied); it never overrides the wait.
`counters` exposes pause seconds, read bytes, written bytes and long-pause count.
The severe-pressure latch and outstanding byte deadline belong to the governor
instance and survive cancellation. The quiet recovery interval restarts whenever
monitoring exits: a later job must pay remaining byte debt and observe a fresh,
continuous quiet recovery before admission.

After each chunk, call `reportBytes({read, written}, signal)`. Reads plus writes
are capped at 4,000,000 bytes/second by default (`bytesPerSecond` overrides it).
Work time counts against the chunk's pacing interval; unrelated idle time earns
no credit. Chunks are allowed to burst, but the next chunk waits out their byte
cost. Import jobs measure Linux `/proc/thread-self/io` syscall bytes, including
page-cache reads and WAL writes; source mmap is disabled so it cannot bypass the
counter. Chunk work is synchronous on the writer thread; no other job runs inside
the measured interval. Tests inject PSI, the clock and byte counters.

### P2 integration API

- `runCpampJob(store, cpampReader, {mode, governor, signal, betweenChunks})`, from
  `importCpamp.ts`: `mode` is `import`, `reconcile` or `verify`. The caller owns
  both handles and must close them. `store` is the writer's `UsageStore`;
  `cpampReader` is opened read-only through `store.ts`'s `openUsageReader` with
  `query_only=1` and `temp_store=MEMORY`. No raw payload buffer is needed.
- `scheduleChunk(kind, work)` adapts both APIs to `WriterQueue.enqueueJob`.
  Do **not** enqueue a whole orchestration: the queue receives only synchronous,
  bounded IO, with byte measurement inside that callback. `runIoChunk` waits for
  PSI before enqueueing, rechecks admission at execution, releases the queue and
  retries if pressure rose, then paces the measured bytes outside the queue.
  Before each queued chunk it yields to the worker's macrotask queue, even when
  the byte budget requires no sleep, so live and cancel messages are serviced.
  `betweenChunks` remains an optional pre-admission hook for direct callers.
  Do not run two jobs with one governor concurrently.
- Import and reconcile keyset by source `id`, 1,000 rows per transaction. The
  store's `importChunk` commits inserts, deduplicated field conflicts and
  `import:cpamp:last_id` together. Existing events always win. Reconcile continues
  that same cursor. Re-running a completed import writes nothing.
- Verify writes nothing. Every mutating pass ends with a separate governed full
  verification up to the captured source maximum, including previously committed
  chunks after a restart. It matches source execution IDs, including live overlaps,
  and independently keyset-scans the target table in bounded pages. Every imported
  target event counts, including extra hours or executions absent from CPAMP;
  `targetOnlyImported` and hourly totals make those extras fail `exact`. Unmatched
  subscribed/drained traffic remains excluded. It compares all mapped
  fields and exact per-UTC-hour rows, failures, seven token sums, latency sum, and
  positive TTFT sum/count. Sums are BigInt internally and decimal strings in the
  report. A missing or duplicate identity prevents an exact verdict. The report
  counts invalid JSON, timestamps and tokens, incomplete/invalid canonical
  breakdowns and non-positive latency. Unmappable rows are skipped and reported;
  review the report before accepting a cursor. No invalid identity is fabricated.
- `cpampRollupCheck.ts` adds the independent level-1 check against CPAMP's own
  `usage_pricing_hourly_provider_rollups_v1`. Its contract comes from CPAMP's
  `internal/repository/usagepricing/repository.go` (`upsertHourlyTableBatch`,
  `CatchUp`, `LoadHourlyRowsTx`) and the live schema, inspected read-only. It sums
  all provider/outcome/model/tier groups for the active `structure_revision`.
  Counters are calls, normalized total input, total output, reasoning, cache read,
  cache creation and total tokens. Cache read includes the rollup's compatible
  legacy `cached_tokens` plus `cache_read_tokens`, matching CPAMP's normalization.
  Uncached input has no independent rollup column; it is still checked against
  raw source rows. SQLite sums are returned as decimal strings to preserve exact
  integers above JavaScript's safe range.
- Rollup metadata, bucket pages and each hour's read snapshot all pass through
  the governor. Candidate hours also include rollup-only buckets, so a whole
  hour missing from both raw stores cannot silently pass. Compare only closed
  hours as of the job's captured wall clock (`nowMs` can be injected), schema 1,
  the same active revision, ready/catching-up state without an error, and buckets
  within the recorded range. The covered event ID must reach that hour's greatest
  source ID. Using IDs rather than a timestamp watermark handles late arrivals into
  older hours. Deleted-raw archive markers also make an hour uncovered: a rebuilt
  cache can include retained history no longer in the raw source table.
- CPAMP keeps ingesting during the dual run, so its global coverage marker is
  normally ahead of this job's verified maximum; that alone never skips an hour.
  An hour is compared unless a CPAMP event with an ID above the verified maximum
  falls in it (reason `hour-has-unverified-events`), because the rollup may already
  include events this job did not verify. The check reads that small tail once with
  one rowid-range query and re-reads it only if `max(id)` changes inside an hour's
  snapshot, so no per-hour scan of `usage_events` occurs. Hours that stay uncovered
  mean the check is not yet complete; rerun it after the tail closes or CPAMP stops.
- `verification.rollups` reports `hours`, `mismatches` and `uncovered` separately,
  with a reason for each uncovered hour (missing tables/state, rebuild/error,
  revision changes, rollup lag, newer unverified events, open or archived hours and
  limited source passes).
  A rollup mismatch makes overall `verification.exact` false. Uncovered hours
  are not mismatches; `rollups.complete` means all candidate hours were covered,
  and accepting the independent check requires both complete coverage and no
  mismatches. Diagnostic `maxRows` passes never claim complete rollup coverage.
- CPAMP's persisted accounting columns are copied. Metadata from `raw_json` is an
  explicit `json_extract` allowlist; headers, fail bodies and client keys are never
  selected. Metadata validation, model suffix handling, timing, presence, tiers
  and session UUID provenance reuse the live normalizer. A persisted token value
  differing from the validated canonical breakdown clears the complete flag.
  Sessions and credential indexes use the store's existing insert path.
- `maxRows` is diagnostic only: it limits each pass, and the verification report
  covers only that prefix. Target accounting includes only the verified execution
  IDs, even when later imported events share their hour. Unlimited runs retain
  the independent target cohort scan and assertions for extra imported rows.
  The final migration check must omit it. An import followed by verification reads
  that prefix twice; respect any diagnostic read limit across both passes.

Run the actual import only in a quiet window: outside 01:00–04:00 UTC and the
12:30 UTC daily fstrim. This module does not schedule jobs or enforce calendar
windows. The first successful off-pool backup is required before the real import;
that operational gate belongs to the coordinator, not these job functions.

### Backups

The backup job API is `new UsageBackup(config, {governor}).run(store, signal)`.
The worker queues only its snapshot operation, with upload and pacing outside
the writer queue. `lastSuccessAtMs` starts at null and advances
only after all required uploads succeed. It is in-memory health state for later metrics, not a durable
backup manifest. Job modules open no databases or network listeners.

`loadBackupConfig(path?)` reads a JSON object from the supplied path (or
`PROX_USAGE_BACKUP_CONFIG`). Its fields are `endpoint`, `bucket`, `accessKeyId`,
`secretAccessKey`, optional `region` (default `us-east-1`), `sessionToken`, and
`tmpfsDir` (default `/dev/shm`). The corresponding `PROX_USAGE_BACKUP_ENDPOINT`,
`_BUCKET`, `_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `_REGION`, `_SESSION_TOKEN` and
`_TMPFS_DIR` environment values override the file. Keep config files private;
secrets and signed URLs must never be logged. No real credentials ship here.

The backup refuses a directory that is not tmpfs, or less than twice the database's
WAL-inclusive logical size in free space. It VACUUMs into a private temporary
directory, then uploads 64 KiB chunks using a PUT signed by the pinned Bun 1.4.3
`S3Client`. Each chunk counts its tmpfs read plus network write and is paced
before sending, with backpressure and no redirect or automatic retry. Temp files
are deleted on success, failure and cancellation. **VACUUM is one indivisible
SQLite operation:** its reads cannot be chunked; admission is PSI-gated and its
measured bytes are charged afterward. It writes only to tmpfs. Revisit the
snapshot method and tmpfs headroom before the database reaches 2 GB.

Object keys are `usage/daily/usage-YYYYMMDD.sqlite` in UTC and, on Sundays,
`usage/weekly/usage-YYYYMMDD.sqlite`. Configure bucket lifecycle expiration at
14 days for the daily prefix and 56 days for the weekly prefix (eight weekly
copies). The client never lists, prunes or deletes objects. It backs up
`usage.sqlite`, including the reserved `client_alias` table; active aliases are a separate private file,
not a backup of that table. The rate book remains a separate git
artifact and the raw buffer is excluded. P4/P2 must arrange rate-book distribution
alongside the backup; there is no rate-book table in the P1 schema.

The coordinator configures the off-pool target and records the quarterly restore
drill. This PR does not contact MinIO, run a real backup or perform a restore drill.


### Worker integration and manual controls

- `writerRuntime.ts` installs the writer worker's message handler; the separately
  bundled `writer.worker.ts` calls it. `bulkJobs.ts` owns one active orchestration,
  a shared governor, the read-only CPAMP handle and a retained `UsageBackup`.
  Source opening and each bounded import/verification chunk use `enqueueJob`.
  Only the backup snapshot uses that queue; upload and all waits stay outside.
- `writerProtocol.ts` carries `import`, `reconcile`, `verify`, `backup`, `prune`, `cancel`
  and `job-status` requests. Replies include a typed `job` report in writer status.
  Start acknowledges admission promptly; poll for completion. A rejected command,
  bad config, source failure, bulk transaction failure or upload failure is
  nonfatal. An event-commit failure remains fatal to collection and flush.
- Reports include an ID, kind, state, timestamps, chunk progress and typed final
  result. Failure text is fixed and never includes paths, source rows, secrets or
  signed URLs. The latest report stays until the next manual start, in memory
  only. IO counters are cumulative for the shared governor, including all jobs;
  backup last-success state survives subsequent failed/cancelled runs for this
  worker's lifetime. Save reports externally before starting another run.
- Shutdown refuses new starts, aborts the active job and settles its orchestration
  (including an in-flight upload pull and source cleanup) before closing the
  store. PSI/pacing checks observe cancellation within a one-second sleep; an
  already-running synchronous chunk or VACUUM must finish first. A failed live
  flush still requests this worker cleanup and retains its unsuccessful result.
  A worker error/exit is tracked separately: outstanding RPCs reject and shutdown
  skips cleanup RPCs to an unavailable worker instead of waiting indefinitely.
- Worker configuration is lazy: `PROX_USAGE_CPAMP_DB_PATH` is the read-only source;
  `PROX_USAGE_BULK_BYTES_PER_SECOND` optionally overrides the 4,000,000-byte budget.
  Backup settings use `loadBackupConfig` above. `UsageWriter.init` also accepts
  these paths/budget as typed config for embedding and synthetic tests. HTTP
  never accepts file paths, budget overrides or backup credentials.
- Import, reconcile, verify, backup and prune remain manual; automatic hour rebuilds
  are described below. Deployment copies optional timers without enabling them.
  On the existing listener at
  `127.0.0.1:18320`, the coordinator explicitly calls:
  - `POST /v1/jobs` with `{"kind":"import"}` (or `reconcile`, `verify`,
    `backup`, `prune`): 202 with the running report, 409 if a job is already active.
  - `POST /v1/jobs/cancel` with `{"jobId":1}`: 202; stale IDs return 409.
    Cancellation is idempotent for the latest finished job. Both commands accept
    optional `clientToken`; accepted tokens are echoed in the report and cancellation
    checks supplied tokens atomically (ownership contract below). Poll until settled.
  - `GET /v1/jobs`: latest report or null. `GET /v1/status` includes the same
    progress under `writer.job`. Both reads refresh the report through worker RPC.
  These routes use `server/http/auth.ts`'s same bearer check as `/v1/status`;
  only `/healthz` is public. Unknown command fields, invalid kinds/IDs, malformed
  JSON and bodies above 1 KiB are rejected. During shutdown starts return 503.
- `proxUsageJobs`, `proxUsageWriter`, `proxUsageIoGovernor` and `proxUsageService`
  tests enforce live commits during PSI, pacing and upload waits; execution-time
  admission; source/transaction/config failures; cancellation and shutdown;
  fatal event failures; bearer protection; and the SQLite-free main runtime graph.
  They use synthetic tmpfs databases and a loopback fake S3 endpoint only.


## Offline parity evidence

`scripts/usage-parity.ts` is the operator-only read exception during the dual run.
It opens CPAMP and Prox with SQLite URI `mode=ro`, read-only flags and
`query_only=1`; it never imports/reconciles, writes events or joins either server's
runtime graph. CPAMP reads force `idx_usage_events_timestamp`, use five-minute
windows and 1,000-row keyset pages. The importer shares only its allowlisted SQL
projection, metadata-key schema and diagnostic-counter factory with this reader.
`scripts/usage-parity/cpampReference.ts` is an independent CPAMP-side oracle:
no Prox normalizer or importer mapping supplies an expected value. Persisted
columns are authoritative, including `service_tier`; raw tiers cannot override
it. Model identities follow CPAMP's persisted-column aggregation expressions;
metadata-only flags/kind/identifiers follow CPAMP's Go envelope contract. This
independent audit intentionally does not reuse the algorithm under test.
Known decoded metadata objects accept only canonical field casing and JSON types.
Case aliases or wrong types produce an unexplained event with reason
`non-canonical CPAMP metadata encoding`; they are never normalized into a match.
Nullable timing offsets and unrelated extension keys retain their existing meaning.

The harness compares the seven token fields and the event identity, timing,
models, provider, tier, failure, status, flags and record kind, plus exporter
account, account-label and client-key-hash dimensions. The import owner's account
SQL fallback (`nullif(snapshot,'')`, then nullable label, then credential index)
is applied to persisted fields, preserving empty labels, whitespace and key-hash
case. No label snapshot timing exception is authorized by this harness. Missing
Prox events require recorded gap evidence as defined below. Subscribed extras fail;
optional outage provenance for reverse-only drained rows is counted separately.

All operations share the existing IO governor and one serial query gate, with a
2-second default minimum gap after completion, cancellable PSI waits, measured
DB-byte pacing and a nonzero exit on unexplained differences, failure or abort.
There are no retries of expensive queries. The only response normalization is
plan §3.3's four volatile fields, relative `cost.usd` tolerance and ordering inside
equal-timestamp runs. Provider and trace provenance differences apply only to
request-detail fields and are counted. A D5 price exception needs two read-only
replays through `queryAnalytics`: the approved deployed book must reproduce the
Prox value, and removing only the two D5 models must reproduce CPAMP's value.
The `coverage-limitations` rule requires every CPAMP sentence except the exact
successive-reads sentence. Extra Prox sentences must be the exact §2.7 conditions
or validated gap/prune forms (overlapping range and incomplete raw coverage).
Missing required sentences, unknown extras and duplicate sentences fail. Both
lists remain in evidence and each changed field/pair is counted. Other coverage
fields and one-sided paging remain exact.

The harness refuses query admission during 01:00–04:00 and 12:20–12:50 UTC.
`--deadline` accepts an absolute UTC timestamp or today's `HH:MMZ`; a delayed start
never rolls the cutoff into tomorrow. The earliest deadline/forbidden boundary
aborts fetches and PSI/pacing waits, and is rechecked at synchronous boundaries.
An incomplete run writes `complete=false`, its termination reason and partial
counts, then exits 2 (unexplained differences exit 1; SIGINT exits 130). The user
unit passes `--deadline 12:00Z` and uses `Type=exec` plus `RuntimeMaxSec=5h30min`
as a backstop. None of these templates is installed or enabled by this work.

The matrix is ported from CPAMP commit `52b12b45e010a766bd69ff55a55e566263d8bede`.
Its current source has 672 quick / 5,904 full base queries, with coupled view
rotation rather than extra time-zone/granularity factors. All view slots are kept
and mapped to UTC. Each backend supplies its own second-page cursor. Reports
reconcile the stale plan counts, expose each axis and window clipping, and retain
both values for every difference. The disabled nightly chain runs quick plus
events for the previous UTC day only after maintenance succeeds; installation
and the two-night cutover decision belong to the coordinator.

Forward CPAMP→Prox event parity compares full fields across every ingest kind;
reverse parity requires only subscribed (`ingest=0`) rows. Accepted matches and
reverse-only rows outside that cohort are counted separately by ingest kind.
Only CPAMP persisted TTFT zero → Prox null with CPAMP metadata decoding to
unknown/unavailable instrumentation is accepted under `ttft-zero-null`.
Measured zeros (first-byte, substantive-content, fallback-packet), latency and
reverse null → zero stay strict. A missing row can use a recorded same-instance
gap only when its positive persisted latency places completion inside the exact
half-open interval, with zero tolerance; either outside bound fails.
No restart implies an unrecorded gap. Gap metadata reads may extend past the
start-time window; CPAMP event scans do not.

A read-only job-status observation notes whether the latest retained successful,
exact import/reconcile completed for the observed window's source IDs. Unknown or
unavailable history is stated as such. It is informational in the read-only parity command: it starts no reconcile,
and missing events remain unexplained until they exist and compare equal. The
separate nightly chain below serializes maintenance before invoking parity.

## Analytics queries

- `validate.ts` owns the strict `AnalyticsQuery` plus catalog boundary (one JSON
  value, no unknown fields, CPAMP byte/range/cursor bounds); only UTC is accepted.
  `handler.ts` authenticates both POST paths with the shared management bearer
  check, bounds streamed JSON to 1 MiB, and never imports a SQLite runtime module.
- `main.ts` mounts `/v1/analytics` and the temporary
  `/v0/management/monitoring/prox-analytics` alias alongside health/status. Rates
  come from `PROX_USAGE_RATES_PATH` (default `/data/usage-rates.json`). A missing
  initial book produces unpriced estimates and a coverage limitation; a failed
  reload keeps the last good book. The mount and approved rate file are deployment
  responsibilities; queries never update the book.
- `lanes.ts` has independent FIFO fast/search lanes, one active query and eight
  waiting in each. Overflow is 503. A 30-second deadline includes body reading,
  admission and execution; expiry is 504, client cancellation 499. Cancellation
  terminates the active worker, releasing its SQLite snapshot, before replacing
  it. Idle workers are reused; close/error listeners stay attached for the worker's
  lifetime, so an idle exit invalidates the cache. Shutdown rejects admission and
  terminates both.
- `query.worker.ts` opens its read-only connection through `store.ts`, performs
  the entire response in one deferred read transaction, serializes the response
  there and closes the connection. It uses the standard `{id, kind, body}` /
  `{id, ok, body}` RPC and also accepts child-process IPC. Its bundle is a separate
  `build:usage` entry beside `main.js` and `writer.worker.js`.
- `analytics.ts` groups by UTC bucket, provider, all three pricing candidates,
  tier, per-event context band, usage flags, record kind and outcome. The current
  book snapshot generates nested SQL CASE expressions over dictionary ids:
  billing, canonical, then requested candidate; thresholds descending, strictly
  exceeded; a configured base-only candidate stops fallback. No stored price
  table or index exists. SQL sums are priced with explicit bands and the P4
  pricing owner. All response sections use the same book/revision and snapshot.
- `analyticsPricing.ts` folds the unchanged SQL rows into CPAMP's pricing keys:
  `(model, billing model, resolved pricing model, context band, tier)`, adding bucket
  for timeline or provider for provider-specific stats. This folds across the
  SQL-only metadata/outcome keys for pricing; retained-event metrics still use all
  SQL rows. Summary stats sort by calls descending then `pricingRowLess` (model,
  billing model, pricing model, tier, band); model views inherit that order.
  Timeline sorts by bucket then `pricingRowLess`. Providers reuse global stats
  when each model has one provider; otherwise they follow the provider query's
  calls-descending order, with ties in its SQL key order (band before tier).
- `pricing.ts` exposes separate aggregate/request estimate boundaries over the
  shared money calculation. CPAMP aggregate tokens have no event metadata:
  presence is always unknown, component-reporting flags do not add request-only
  reasons, and only aggregate costs carry call counts. `parity.ts` adds the legacy
  reason after the aggregate's pricing reasons. Request costs keep event presence
  and component limitations, but no legacy-kind reason or call counts.
- Known supplementary rows are excluded from counts, pricing, latency, selectors
  and request detail, as CPAMP does. Selectors preserve the range/search while
  ignoring the provider, model and outcome filters. The page cursor changes only
  detail, never whole-scope totals.
- `latency.ts` selects exact positive-sample nearest ranks in typed arrays for
  the range, bucket, model and provider. Zero TTFT remains visible in detail but
  does not enter percentile samples. Average latency uses positive measurements.
- `search.ts` filters the time-clustered events after matching dictionary values;
  identifier detail is looked up only for events in that range. Long identifiers
  additionally try indexed exact execution/request/session matches. Substring
  fallback remains, including CPAMP's SQL LIKE wildcards, ASCII SQL lower(), and
  Unicode-lowercased query. It adds no search index or persisted projection.
- The inspector is an explicit allowlist. Token zero is visible only when its
  presence/component flags report it; positive counters stay visible. User agents
  pass `credentialText.ts`, a port of CPAMP's credential-text scrubber; path queries
  are removed again at serialization. Error summaries contain only the safe code
  or `Execution failed`. No key/hash or fail body is returned.
- `parity.ts` contains exactly the two P10 compatibility oddities: the legacy
  record-kind reason on every nonempty aggregate estimate and source attribution
  based on the current page. Coverage otherwise uses range-wide retention/gaps,
  import provenance, rate-book state and unknown providers, without claiming the
  event stream is an ingress ledger.
- Provider/trace provenance is limited by P1: `provider` and `trace_id` are the
  stored payload fields. CPAMP detail uses credential-provider snapshot and
  response-header trace id. Neither is inferred from another field. P6 must check
  these against imported/live rows; the response schema remains version 1.

Regression tests cover snapshot isolation, SQL pricing bands, null measurements,
search, coverage, worker IPC, bearer routing, bounded lanes, cancellation and a
main-thread graph free of SQLite. `scripts/usage-query-benchmark.ts` creates and
removes its 960,000-row synthetic store entirely in `/dev/shm`, using the P1 store
API, and records 50 warm worker responses per view while inserting synthetic
traffic. Run it with `ionice -c3 nice -n10` after IO `full avg10` drops below 5.
The live performance/parity gate is a separate deployment responsibility; a
30-day p95 above 1 s requires P5b before P6, per the plan.


### Raw-buffer expiry and schedules

`prune` fixes its cutoff at job admission minus 30 days. `store.pruneRawBefore`
selects at most 1,000 expired payload keys through the existing covering time
index, then deletes those keys. Fresh payload BLOB pages are never scanned. Rejects
keep a bounded 1,000-id scan, including fresh rows, without a startup index build. Events and event metadata are never
pruned. Each page uses the shared 4 MB/s read-plus-write governor and yields to live
batches. A failed raw transaction fails only the bulk job; collection continues.

`deploy/prox-usage-job@.service` remains a manual bearer-protected submission
unit; its shell script reads the key and pipes the header, never using curl argv.
The sole shipped nightly timer is `prox-usage-nightly.timer`, nonpersistent at
04:20 UTC, installed disabled. Its oneshot runs the installed bundle
`~/.local/share/prox/usage-jobs/usage-nightly.js` (built from `scripts/usage-nightly.ts` by
`bun run build:usage-jobs` and installed atomically by `scripts/deploy-homelab.sh`, never run
from a checkout; it spawns `usage-parity.js` beside itself; evidence goes to
`PROX_USAGE_EVIDENCE_DIR`, `~/.local/share/prox/usage-evidence/`) under ionice/nice: prune → reconcile → optional backup → parity. Each job is polled
through GET `/v1/jobs` until `succeeded` AND `finishedAtMs` is present, so source
cleanup releases the bulk slot before the next start. A failure, replaced job,
HTTP error or nonzero parity stops the chain; incomplete parity remains exit 2.
Every admission and wait uses the same PSI/UTC gates and today's noon cutoff.
At cutoff/interruption the chain requests cancellation of its active job and
starts no further step; cancellation request success is not a terminal-success
claim. Submit POSTs use an independent 15-second timeout so cutoff/interruption
does not lose the accepted ID. Ambiguous response failures trigger a bounded
status read; only a running same-kind job echoing the submission's unique
`clientToken` grants cancellation ownership. Kind/time matching never does.
The token is generated before each POST, carried through writer RPC and retained
in the job report. POST `/v1/jobs` accepts optional `clientToken` (1–64 ASCII
letters/digits/underscore/hyphen); malformed values are 400. Cancellation carries
the same token and the worker atomically refuses mismatches with 409. Existing
manual commands without a token retain their behavior; the token supplements,
and never replaces, bearer authentication. Recovery without an exact match
starts/cancels nothing else and reports `no-owned-job`. HTTP rejection
(especially 409) never grants ownership. Nightly admission failures retain the
attempted kind and numeric HTTP status as `refused: {kind, status}` and name that
refusal in the safe error. Response bodies and credential text are never copied
into the failure report. A rejected submission triggers no recovery read or
cancellation, and no retry except the one below.

**Backfill admission retry.** A rollup backfill reserves bulk admission, so POST
`/v1/jobs` answers 409 `Rollup backfill in progress` (`ROLLUP_BACKFILL_BUSY_ERROR`).
Only a 409 whose JSON `error` equals that fixed string is retried: every 30 s for
at most 15 min from the kind's first attempt, each attempt with a fresh
`clientToken`, all inside the same PSI gate, execution window and noon cutoff. A
backfill refusal admitted no job, so ownership is unaffected; any other 409 (an
active bulk job, an ID mismatch, an empty body) and every non-HTTP failure is
never retried. Give-up keeps the `refused` report (its error adds
`after N attempts` when N > 1); a cutoff during a retry wait ends `incomplete`
with no further submit. The report's `attempts` maps each submitted kind to its
POST count, and a later successful admission clears the stale `refused`.

**CPAMP subscribe guard.** CPAMP runs `auto` and, if it starts while a proxy is
unreachable, falls back to polling a queue that stays empty once Prox holds the
subscription, so its history would silently stop. At chain start, before any job,
the nightly reads CPAMP's `GET http://127.0.0.1:18317/status` with the admin key in
`~/.config/prox/cpa-admin-key` (read per request, sent only as the bearer header,
never stored or reported; the unit has no `ProtectHome`, so no mount is needed).
`collectors[]` (primary plus extra upstreams) carries `mode` (configured),
`transport` (live) and `collector` state. The guard passes only with at least two
collectors that are all `transport: subscribe` and `collector: running`. Otherwise
the night is `failed` (exit 1) with `cpamp: {ok: false, collectors}`, no job
started. An unreachable, unauthorized or malformed status is the same failure with
empty `collectors`. The report copies only a closed vocabulary of these three
fields, never CPAMP text. A failed night is never clean for the two-clean-nights
gate. The check is once at chain start, not a monitor.
The oneshot has `TimeoutStartSec=7h40min`; parity has a 5h30min cap and
absolute noon deadline. The standalone parity service keeps `RuntimeMaxSec=5h30min`.
The old independent prune/reconcile/backup/parity timers are removed from shipping;
deployment disables/stops each old timer and removes its unit/enable link before
daemon-reload, tolerating missing units but failing on manager errors. The new
chain timer stays disabled until operator enablement.
No live unit is installed, enabled or disabled by this work.

**Backup chain gate:** `PROX_USAGE_ENABLE_PACED_BACKUP` defaults to `0`, so the
step is explicitly skipped until the paced snapshot and restore gates land.
Only then may the operator set `1` through the nightly service override. Upload
pacing alone does not make the current VACUUM snapshot bounded.


## Exporter lifetime counters and client names

`exporter.ts` owns a writer-worker in-memory fold over the existing canonical event
columns. Startup folds retained events once; `store.onCommit` adds only newly
committed events after the outer transaction succeeds. Duplicate executions and
rolled-back transactions add nothing. No derived state is persisted. The exporter adds no migration: no original-counter metadata or secondary
import cursor is required; P5b independently adds its hourly rollup tables. Raw-buffer expiry never deletes events or lowers counters.
Any future event archive must preserve lifetime totals before deleting events.

Metrics use the same canonical input/output/cache/reasoning counters as analytics.
Known supplementary rows are excluded, as in analytics. Non-null latency samples
supply the latency sum/count; only positive TTFT supplies its sum/count. Successful
zero-total events supply the accounting-gap count. Pricing calls P4's
`estimateAggregateCost` with per-event context bands and the same ordered
billing/canonical/requested model fallback as analytics. No exporter-only `-fast`,
billing-only, generic cache-price or Python summation rules remain. Partial and
unknown prices keep P4's semantics. Priced-model count uses the shared rate
inventory's priced classification.

The public model label still uses the requested model, matching the deployed
exporter, while pricing uses the canonical model internally. Account/provider
values retain their stored snapshots. Client aliases preserve exact names and the
old `key <first 8 hash chars>` / `unknown` fallbacks. The shared fixture
`tests/fixtures/usageExporterLabels.json` compares actual old SQL label values with
the authenticated endpoint response, including a model suffix and Unicode names.

Historical account-label limits are explicit. CPAMP's exporter used
`COALESCE(NULLIF(account_snapshot,''), auth_label_snapshot, auth_index)` without
trimming: a whitespace-bearing account snapshot stays whitespace-bearing, and an
empty non-null auth label stays empty (rendered as `unknown`). The importer trims
both snapshots and treats an empty auth label as absent, falling back to the auth
index. Those two historical cases cannot be reconstructed from the retained dims;
analytics normalization and storage remain unchanged.

The coordinator checked Prometheus's distinct account sets for both request and
token counters across all history: exactly `321267c5b92801be`, `d5a08f237a58a2e5`,
`research@astrabit.io`, `wrollings@astrabit.io`, `wrollings@gmail.com`, and
`wrollings@pm.me`. No value has surrounding whitespace or is empty/`unknown`.
This is coordinator-provided evidence, not a live query run by this implementation.
NULL-auth-label fallbacks already match. The cutover must still compare the
**distinct account/client/provider/model label sets** from the old exporter and
this endpoint and block on any difference; see the swap PR's label guard.

For live events, CPAMP fills account/auth-label snapshots from its credential
snapshot resolver: account first, then auth label, with provider-specific identity
validation and name/email/file fallbacks. Prox `labels.ts` instead takes the
management listing's safe account, explicit label or auth index and captures that
value at ingestion. Existing safe account/explicit-label cases match; differing
refresh snapshots or missing fields can differ. No claim of universal live-label
identity is made. The required swap guard covers actual label sets, while P5's
analytics dimensions and response normalization remain untouched.

Rate-only edits reprice groups without reading events; changed thresholds or
pricing-candidate membership trigger a new fold, because a newly configured
base-only candidate can stop fallback to a different candidate's context tiers.
Client-name edits relabel groups without a scan. A failed projection invalidates
the fold for a later rebuild; it never turns a committed event into failed ingest.

`GET /v1/exporter` uses the existing loopback listener and management bearer check.
Its version-1 JSON contains groups per provider, requested model, account, client
and success/failed status, token/cache totals, seconds sums/counts, zero-token
successes and nullable current-rate cost; plus newest event epoch seconds and
priced-model count. It remains additive during the dual run. Source health reports
instance, state, subscribed and last-event age in seconds; no event since process
start is `null`, never a healthy zero age.

The version-1 snapshot also includes `jobs` for import, reconcile, verify, backup
and prune, each with nullable `last_success_seconds` and `last_failure_seconds`.
The writer loads `meta` keys `job-outcome:<kind>` at init and stores JSON
`lastSuccessAtMs` / `lastFailureAtMs` from terminal `finishedAtMs` before publishing
completion; cancellation changes neither. Saved values must be JSON objects with
nullable, finite, non-negative integer millisecond fields. Invalid JSON or shapes
default both fields to null; an invalid field defaults only that field to null,
preserving valid fields and other job kinds. The sanitized boolean
`jobs_outcome_error` reports any invalid saved outcome encountered at init and
remains true for that writer's lifetime; collection and exporter requests continue.
Saved outcomes survive restarts and support a missed-nightly alert such as
`time() - cliproxy_usage_job_last_success_timestamp_seconds{kind="reconcile"} > 30 * 60 * 60`,
once the exporter maps the field to a gauge; never-run jobs remain null and need a
separate missing-success check.

`rate_book_loaded` and `client_aliases_loaded` distinguish a first-load failure
from a failed edit with a last-good snapshot. `rate_book_error` and
`client_alias_error` report the latest reload result. The HTTP response can carry
source health when configuration has never loaded. The cutover shim must skip its
usage counters until both loaded flags are true. A reload error with loaded=true
may keep serving the last-good values. An explicit empty alias map counts as
loaded; unknown clients then deliberately use the documented fallbacks.

Aliases come from `~/.config/prox-usage/client-aliases.json` (0600), or
`PROX_USAGE_CLIENT_ALIASES_PATH`; the unit sets `/config/client-aliases.json` on its
existing read-only config mount. The P4 format is
`{"client_alias":[{"api_key_hash":"<64 lowercase SHA-256 hex>","alias":"<name>"}]}`.
The loader checks permissions, reloads on mtime changes, validates hashes/names,
and retains last-good names on invalid edits. It never writes the file or database.
Full hashes and raw keys never leave the endpoint. Alias files and P4 alias
artifacts are ignored by git. See `docs/PROX-SETUP.md` for naming a new client.

The exporter rollout has two steps. First add source health beside the unchanged
CPAMP counters. At Step E, after Step B's history import completes, switch counters
to this endpoint and add `source="prox-usage"` to every usage counter/gauge. Old
series end; new series start at canonical lifetime totals. Prometheus rate/increase
does not count a new series' first sample, avoiding a legacy-value reset spike.
Lifetime-total dashboards jump once. Canonical output and P4 pricing change values,
including D5's Fable/Terra cost and removal of old pricing quirks. Apply the Sonnet
5.5 cache-read correction at the identity change. Any later price decrease can
lower the cost counter and requires a fresh source identity (e.g. `prox-usage-2`).
A rollback resumes old counters and can count traffic already counted in the new
series. None of these rollout actions is performed by this implementation.

Tests compare independent fixture totals and the analytics engine over identical
scopes and enforce commit/rollback/deduplication and the current schema, exercise reload readiness
and private aliases, and verify bearer routing, exact label values and source health.


## Hourly rollup (P5b)

- `aggregate.ts` owns the SQL group dimensions, additive integer columns and
  context-band expression shared by raw reads and rebuilds. Migration 2 adds
  `usage_hour_rollup`: its key is the UTC hour plus provider, model, billing
  model, requested model, tier, context band, usage flags, record kind and failed.
  Base bands use the internal sentinel -1. No price or rate is stored.
- `rollup.ts` replaces one closed hour in one writer transaction. Rows are pure
  functions of that hour's events; sums are never incremented. Each row stores
  sorted positive latency and TTFT samples as signed 32-bit integer blobs.
  A timing above 2,147,483,647 ms makes the entire hour unsupported and raw, so
  conversion cannot wrap or lose precision. Zero TTFT stays out of percentiles.
- The shared insertion transaction used by `UsageStore.insert` and P3's
  `importChunk` marks each affected hour dirty in the event transaction,
  including imports, late events, and the open hour. Duplicate execution ids
  invalidate nothing. Rebuild, state publication and dirty clearing commit
  together; failure preserves the old rollup and dirty state. Consumers never
  read stale rows while dirty. Future event retention must invalidate affected
  hours in its deletion transaction as well; no event pruning exists here yet.
- The writer schedules at most one `enqueueJob('rollup', ...)` at a time, one
  hour per job, with a one-second timer between jobs. Live jobs have priority.
  The event-loop yield lets live messages enter the queue between hours. A bulk
  import can leave thousands of durable dirty hours without creating thousands
  of queued callbacks. Shutdown cancels maintenance instead of draining history.
  A failed background replacement logs a safe error and retries; raw reads remain
  correct. `rollupMaintenance.ts` calls `UsageBulkJobs.runRollupChunk`, sharing
  P3's one governor and `runIoChunk` contract with manual jobs: pressure
  waits precede queue admission, and measured thread IO bytes are charged after
  each hour, including a failed hour. Pressure/byte waits stay outside the queue,
  so a paused rollup cannot hold live commits. Shutdown aborts these waits.
  Backfill reserves bulk admission from its first chunk until a no-work result,
  including pressure/pacing waits and the yield between hours: manual/nightly
  POST `/v1/jobs` returns 409 throughout that interval. If a manual job is already
  active, the maintenance tick does nothing and retries later without advancing
  its durable discovery cursor or dirty set. This uses the refusal-and-pause
  policy; it adds no report kind and never overwrites a manual job's client token.
- Bearer-protected GET `/v1/status` includes `rollup.backfill`, refreshed through
  the existing writer RPC without main-thread SQLite or an extra history scan.
  States are `running`, `paused`, `waiting-for-job`, `done` and `failed`.
  `currentHour` is the most recently selected UTC hour in epoch milliseconds,
  null before selection and after draining. `hoursCompleted` counts distinct
  successfully processed hours since writer start (including already-clean
  discovery visits); `hoursTotal` stays null. Pause reasons distinguish
  `io-pressure`, `io-pacing`, `between-hours` and `bulk-job`. `lastFailure` retains
  a safe fixed error, epoch-millisecond timestamp and selected hour after recovery.
  This status is in memory only. Backfill and refused submissions never write
  `job-outcome:<kind>` metadata. Bulk POSTs refused for backfill retain HTTP 409
  and return the safe error `Rollup backfill in progress`. Other worker errors
  retain their generic safe messages.
- Migration 2 creates empty tables only. Pre-migration events are discovered
  using a persisted time cursor and a primary-key seek, one hour per maintenance
  job, without rewriting or grouping the events table at startup. Already-built
  hours are skipped. Late imports behind the cursor carry their own dirty marks.
- Context bands depend on the book's model membership and thresholds. Each
  completed hour carries a hash of that layout. A layout change makes old hours
  read raw until rebuilt; rate-only, service-rate and provenance edits reuse
  sums and samples and apply current prices at query time. Different worker
  book snapshots remain safe because a reader checks its own layout hash.
- `rollupRead.ts` selects only fully included, closed, clean, supported hours
  under the reader's current layout. All other time spans read `events` in the
  same snapshot. It merges integer sums by the full raw SQL group key in
  TypeScript before pricing, and merges exact samples into the same nearest-rank
  owner (`latency.ts`). SQLite concatenates sample bytes by bucket/model/provider
  and casts the result back to BLOB before Bun sees it; no text is decoded and
  NUL/invalid UTF-8 byte patterns are covered by regression tests. Pricing and
  ordered reasons use the same groups and ordering in both paths. Request detail stays raw. `coverage.ts` owns range-wide
  import/provider facts, including supplementary events; rebuilds retain those
  facts in `usage_hour_coverage` and reads merge them with the same raw time spans.
  Coverage therefore avoids an otherwise redundant full-range scan without
  changing which events it describes.
- Any model/provider/outcome filter or nonempty search forces the whole response
  to raw events. A future dimension may use rollups only if the rollup retains
  it and equivalence coverage is extended. The authenticated query-only boolean
  `debug_force_raw: true` forces raw reads for P6; it adds no response fields and
  changes no shared browser contract. Range, catalog, pagination and UTC bucket
  choices otherwise retain their existing semantics.

`tests/proxUsageRollup.test.ts` compares entire `AnalyticsResponse` documents
without normalizing floats, reason arrays or any field, using a fixed clock on
four seeded randomized stores, mixed dirty/imported/open/partial hours, band and
tier mixtures, pagination, layout changes and unsupported timings. Additional
checks cover transactional failure, duplicates, pre-migration discovery and a
3,000-hour import drained one job at a time. These synthetic tests do not replace
P6's comparison with CPAMP or a live performance gate.
